                    "The Last Bell" follows 18 year-old Dylan, as she 
                    contends with taking care of her grandmother Marge 
                    in home hospice care. The short is a snapshot into 
                    the complexities of end of life care and an intimate 
                    portrait of an intergenerational relationship.
                    <br><br>
                    Shot over 3 days (April 8th-10th, 2022) in Altadena, CA, The Last Bell
                    was shot with 95% of the crew and 100% of the cast being women and/or diverse
                    or identify under the LGBT+ umbrella.

                <p>
                    Ten years ago I was in between the summer of my senior year 
                    of high school and freshman year of college. I thought I was 
                    going into three months of pure freedom. I had my first boyfriend, 
                    a great friend group, and travel plans ahead. I never predicted that 
                    I’d wake up one morning with my grandmother dying in the living room 
                    downstairs, and that it would be partially my responsibility to care for her. 
                    To make things worse… my mom got her a bell to assist with summoning me at her 
                    every beck and call. 
                    <br><br>
                    The relationship I had with that grandmother was complicated. She was 
                    a survivor of an alcoholic husband, had mostly undiagnosed bipolar, and 
                    was occasionally convinced that Jesus was in the room with her. At 18, none
                    of that seemed to matter. I was simply angry and confused. Why was she there 
                    with us? She seemed perfectly capable of doing all the things she kept asking for.
                    Three weeks in, I saw her begin to unravel. First it was small things like appetite 
                    and then the events grew. One night, I found myself alone with her and had to assist 
                    in a way that opened my eyes to the vulnerability of death. It was in these moments 
                    that I evolved from a selfish righteous teenager, to someone who understood that we 
                    all deserve to be loved, especially in our final hours. When we die, and we lose the 
                    abilities we take for granted, it’s up to our loved ones to remind us that our spirit 
                    transcends our bodies. 
                    <br><br>
                    I’ve thought about the stories from her passing for years. I knew I wanted to take the 
                    evolution I had and infuse it into a character. I tried to write this, and tired again, 
                    but was stuck. And then the summer of 2021, almost ten years to the day, my other grandmother 
                    passed away. Her passing was a true celebration of life, a joyful mourning of her and her legacy. 
                    It was only after experiencing both deaths, that I was able to merge the stories and fulfill each of 
                    characters’ evolution. Enjoy, <strong>The Last Bell</strong>
